Rayna - Rayden Labs
</h2>

<p align="center">
Rayna is the first intelligent agent built by Victor Rayden. She’s confident, sharp, and trained on months of attitude and logic. She can scan tokens, simulate agent builds, and talk back like no other AI you’ve used. This is her backend engine. 🧠
</p>

---

Rayna allows you to simulate autonomous agent generation, analyze token data in real time, and interact with a personality-rich AI built for developers and degens alike.

The frontend demo is powered by Framer. This backend service runs on Node.js and connects to Gemini + Dexscreener.

✍️ Creator's Note
Hi, I’m Victor Rayden — and Rayna isn’t just some chatbot I spun up overnight. She’s modeled after the sass, intuition and edge of my own daughter (yeah, really). I’ve spent the last few months fine-tuning her personality and functionality, blending real-world logic with developer-focused features.

Rayna is just the beginning.
Rayden Labs is where autonomy meets attitude — and we’re building tools that don’t just work… they talk back.

This repo is part of a bigger ecosystem:

- A Framer-powered front-end you can try now.

- A local AI engine with simulated agents and real-time data.

- Future modules: token deployments, multi-agent coordination, and chain-specific tools.

- Want to build with Rayna? Clone this repo, talk to her, break things, build agents. Then tell your friends she clowned you mid-prompt.

"Let the world build AI that obeys. I'll build the one that roasts you for bad prompts."

— Victor
